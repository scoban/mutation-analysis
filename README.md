# Mutation Analysis Experiments

## Introduction

In this section, we will discuss the mutation analysis and conduct an experiment using different mutation analysis tools. 

This is a mutation analysis experiments. The tools are major mutation, mujava, judy and pit testing frameworks. 

PIT testing is a maven plugin, which is added in the project pom file, therefore, there is no a project related 
to PIT testing.

PIT testing is performed in logback-mutation workspace, which it is integrated into software development process.


This repository is a workspace for the other mutation testing frameworks as mentioned above. Since they are difficult to 
integrate in SDLC, we will try to find a way to execute test units using Apache Ant Build Framework.

## Background

The reader should have an understanding of unit testing development.
The reader also have a background of Java Programming Language, JUnit Framework.

## Tools

- PIT
What is PIT? Who created ? 
PIT Mutation Analysis tool is a modern, easy to integrate into Software Development Lifecycle.

- Mujava

- Major

- Judy

## Experiment

In this section, we will perform experiments for four different mutation testing tools. We will show performance of
each tools and compare them. These tools are used in open source logging framework called logback 
(https://github.com/qos-ch/logback). This framework is available open source and there are quite enough number of 
test case written manually by author. Therefore, It is an ideal candiate to perform mutation testing. 

There are steps to run mutation analysis for each mutation tools. Some of them has own compiler, own set of tools 
to generate mutants successfully.

    We will firstly experiment using PIT testing tools.
