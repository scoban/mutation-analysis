# Mutation Analysis Experiments

## Introduction

This is a mutation analysis experiments. The tools are major mutation, mujava, judy and pit testing frameworks. 

PIT testing is a maven plugin, which is added in the project pom file, therefore, there is no a project related to PIT testing.
PIT testing is performed in logback-mutation workspace, which it is integrated into software development process.


This repository is a workspace for the other mutation testing frameworks as mentioned above. Since they are difficult to 
integrate in SDLC, we will try to find a way to execute test units using Apache Ant Build Framework.
